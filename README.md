# Randomart

Makes this thing! From the command line!

```
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|+o               |
|+=               |
|X A              |
|=B               |
|*o0     S        |
|+Bo  . o         |
|XBoo..o .        |
|XA*.oo. .        |
|BB=o. .o         |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

This has no practical use. I was bored while watching [Defenders][defenders].
