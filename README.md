# Randomart

Makes this thing! From the command line!

```
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|+o               |
|+=               |
|X A              |
|=B               |
|*o0     S        |
|+Bo  . o         |
|XBoo..o .        |
|XA*.oo. .        |
|BB=o. .o         |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

This has no practical use. I was bored while watching [Defenders][defenders].


## Others

There are other randomart projects floating around. The few I ran across are:

- https://github.com/therebelrobot/randomart - a fork of:
- https://github.com/purpliminal/randomart - a javascript port of:
- https://github.com/calmh/randomart - written in go

I choose to make my own port of the go version, for no good reason. 😳
